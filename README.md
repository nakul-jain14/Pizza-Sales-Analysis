# Pizza Sales Analysis Project

This project analyzes pizza sales data to provide actionable insights using SQL and Power BI. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard and SQL queries to help the business understand sales trends, customer preferences, and optimize performance.

## Project Overview

- **SQL Part**: 
  - Imported raw pizza sales data into MS SQL Server.
  - Wrote SQL queries to extract key metrics such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, and total orders.
  - Verified results with SQL queries to ensure data accuracy for the Power BI dashboard.

- **Power BI Part**:
  - Connected Power BI to MS SQL Server and built dynamic dashboards.
  - Visualized KPIs like total revenue, average order value, and total pizzas sold.
  - Created detailed charts for daily and monthly sales trends, pizza category and size performance, and best/worst-selling pizzas.

## Key Features

- **SQL**: 
  - Imported data into MS SQL Server and wrote complex queries for key business metrics.
  - Calculated KPIs like total revenue, average order value, and pizza sales per order.
  - Optimized queries for performance and accuracy.
  
- **Power BI**:
  - Built an interactive dashboard with filters for pizza category, size, and date ranges.
  - Visualized sales trends with bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
  - Analyzed top 5 and bottom 5 pizza sellers by revenue, quantity, and orders.
